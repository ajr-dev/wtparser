# wtparser
Parse a provided replay file

I added:
- AI kills
- Naval kills
- Team kills
- Chat messages

I stopped working on this to figure out anything else. I'm providing the code as-is with a few tweaks as this was converted to javascript for a replay lookup function in https://darkthunder.io way back
